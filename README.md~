<b>How to play Tanks</b> </br>
Tanks is a two player game. The rules for Tanks are as follows: The goal is to destroy your enemy tanks. To do this, you must shoot projectiles at your enemy tank and hit it directly 5 times to deplete its energy bar. Tanks also will be damaged by explosions that occur close to them. To launch projectiles, when it is your turn, click and drag your mouse around the screen. Doing this will make an arrow appear. This arrow represents the initial velocity and direction of the projectile. When you want to launch your projectile based on the initial velocity and the current wind (represented by the white arrow in the top center of the screen), release the mouse. This will launch the projectile, while will explode upon impact with a wall, your enemy tank, or yourself. If you hit your enemy directly 5 times, or completely deplete its energy bar by hitting close to it, you win the game. </br> </br>

<b>How to navigate Tanks</b> </br>
The first window is the start window, which gives you an option to either begin the game, or read the rules first. To read the rules, click "How to Play". After reading the rules, there will be a "Start" button to begin the game, as well as in the original start window. Clicking "Start" will take you to the Tanks Window, which is where the game is played. To play, follow the rules above. On the right side of the screen, there is a menu bar. There is a "Restart" button, which brings you back to the Start window, and a "How to Play" button, which creates a pop-up with the instructions again. To begin playing after pressing "How to Play," click "Resume." When a player wins, the menu bar will switch to a winner bar, telling you who won, and giving options to "Play Again," which brings you back to the start window, and "Exit," which closes the game. </br> </br>

MR. K: This isn't a cheat, per se, but if you want to skip having to play the whole game, note that you can kill yourself by aiming slightly above yourself (aiming below doesn't work).
